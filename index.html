            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>I am currently studying Information and
                communications technology / software development
                in Business College Helsinki. I am currently 
                looking for an internship/trainee position since
                I'm planning to finish the education in the spring
                2020.
                I am currently specializing in Fullstack development.
                I have also learned the basics of Java, Frontend development,
                (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Wordpress) and MySQL.
                In addition to the courses in Business College, I have also
                finished some courses organized by Udemy and 
                the University of Helsinki (the faculty of Science).
                <br />
                I have a Master's degree in Social science and I have experience
                as a (specialist) social worker in the field of gerontology 
                for about 7 years. Therefore I have excellent understanding 
                about ageing and social aspects of people. I have also experience
                in development and projects.
